                I currently live in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with my wife Lulu, a correspondent for NPR, our two-year-old daughter Cassenia and our two Mexican street mutts. I am the South America correspondent for The Times newspaper, and for about a decade I was the paper's Middle East correspondent. While there I covered the conflicts in Israel and Palestine, Iraq, the Arab Spring in Egypt, Libya and Syria. I have also reported on Afghanistan, the Russian invasion of Georgia, the Nato occupation of Kosovo, the civil war in Macedonia, the Mexico drugs wars, and I was also in New Orleans when it was flooded after Hurricane Katrina.</p>

                <p>The time I spent in the Middle East inspired me to write The Spiders of Allah: Travels of an Unbeliever on the Front Lines of Holy Wars, which won a Booklist Editors Choice award and was listed as a Book of the Year by Mother Jones magazine. My fascination with humanity's vivid imagination, and its ability to create weird, wonderful and often terrifying beliefs, led me to write a science fiction novel, Cronix, a story of where god and evolution meet in a man-made paradise.</p>

                <p>Aside from writing books and articles, I love to read, both fiction and non-fiction, ski and scuba dive when the opportunity arises, travel, dine well and drink cocktails in fancy glasses. I also love to travel, fortunately: my current favourite place is Tulum, in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsular, where you can lie on a hammock on a golden beach, watching pelicans dive into the Caribbean next to the ruins of a Mayan temple, the first place that Europeans ever set eyes on native Americans.
